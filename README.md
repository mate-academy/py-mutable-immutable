# Mutable and Immutable

- Read [the guideline](https://github.com/mate-academy/py-task-guideline/blob/main/README.md) before start
- Implement the task:

There are 8 variables of different data types in the main module.

Your task is to create dictionary `sorted_variables` with two keys: 
`"mutable"` and `"immutable"`.
Each value should be equal to a list that contains all variables of corresponding type.
`
Example with `other variables:
```python
a = 123
b = []
c = "Hi!"
d = [1, 2]

sorted_variables = {
    "mutable": [b, d],
    "immutable": [a, c]
}
```
